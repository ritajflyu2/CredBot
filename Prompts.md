made on the site, reference the sources from your search results, perform logical reasoning analysis to
determine whether this website is high in credibility, medium in credibility, or low in credibility, using the
following criteria:

Uses Credible Sources: to be credible, the site should gather and present their information responsibly.
Examples that support this criteria and would be beneficial to the site’s credibility include: The site
generally references reputable sources for its information; The site generally publishes claims that can be
fact-checked by gathering information from credible sources or direct evidence; the site points out false
claims if such quotes are used in articles to ensure readers are aware of its falsity; when using attributions
of non-original content, attributions are given and are accurate.
No Misinformation: to be credible, a site should be consistently factual and rely on credible information
and sources. Examples of misinformation include : 1. Does not use facts. 2. Deliberately chooses to use false
information/misinformation. 3. Spreads fake news, conspiracy theories, or propaganda as fact. Instead,
the site should generally report on events factually and present information in context.

a credible site can have a particular bias and political affiliation, but it cannot use misinformation, fake
news, or scientifically inaccurate conspiracies to support its bias.
